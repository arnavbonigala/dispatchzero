# Golden Minute

A self-improving ambulance dispatcher, tested on San Francisco's real 911 history and fed by live traffic cameras. See `OVERVIEW.md` for the idea and `GOLDEN_MINUTE.md` for the build plan.

## Setup

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python backend/fetch.py
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

`fetch.py` downloads the last 5 full weeks of SF ambulance calls (weeks 1 to 4 train, week 5 frozen), ambulance posts, unit home posts, SF Caltrans cameras, and the OpenStreetMap road graph into `data/` (gitignored). Pass `--skip-graph` to skip the road graph.

## Layout

| Path | Owner | What |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/contracts.py` | All | Frozen shapes: `Call`, `IdleUnit`, `CallResult`, `Summary`, `Version`, `CameraReading`, policy signatures |
| `backend/fetch.py` | A | Data download |
| `backend/sim.py` | A | `replay(calls, policy, slowdowns, version, split) -> (results, summary)`. Currently a stub that returns historical times, so C can build against it |
| `backend/policies/baseline.py` | A | Reference policy: each unit at its home post, closest idle unit sent |
| `backend/agent.py` | C | Improvement loop |
| `backend/api.py` | C | FastAPI |
| `backend/cameras.py` | B | Caltrans → YOLO → `CameraReading` |
| `fixtures/` | B, C | Sample `results.json`, `summary.json`, `versions.jsonl`, `cameras.json`, `posts.json` in contract shape. Regenerate with `python backend/sim.py --fixtures` |
| `frontend/` | B | Vite + React + Leaflet |

## Policy contract

A policy is a Python file in `backend/policies/` with two functions:

```python
def post_plan(hour: int, units: list[str]) -> dict[str, int]
def choose_unit(call: Call, idle: list[IdleUnit], eta) -> str
```

`eta(unit, call)` returns drive seconds from the unit's post to the call.
